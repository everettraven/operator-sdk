      Adds a new `ansible-external/v1-alpha` plugin. The only user facing difference is that the
      image used in the scaffolded `Dockerfile` `FROM` directive is now 
      `quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator-plugins:<version>`. The first version
      tag that is usable is `v0.1.2`.

        In your `Dockerfile`, replace the `FROM` directive of:
        ```
        FROM quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator:v1.31.0
        ```
        to:
        ```
        FROM quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator-plugins:v0.1.2
        ```

        In your `Makefile`, replace:
        ```
        curl -sSLo $(ANSIBLE_OPERATOR) https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/download/v1.31.0/ansible-operator_$(OS)_$(ARCH) ;\
        ```
        with:

        curl -sSLo $(ANSIBLE_OPERATOR) https://github.com/operator-framework/ansible-operator-plugins/releases/download/v0.1.2/ansible-operator_$(OS)_$(ARCH) ;\
        ```
