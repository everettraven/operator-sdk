      Add File-Based Catalog support for both `run bundle` and `run bundle-upgrade` subcommands. 
      Infer the image type and handle FBC scenarios accordingly for both commands. For FBC images,
      Operator Registry APIs are called for rendering the bundle and/or the index image and serving these images
      through the registry pod using a gRPC port. For images that are SQLite based, 
      `opm registry add` and `opm serve` commands will be called during the registry pod creation. 
      Support for these old opm commands will be deprecated and completely removed in the future.
